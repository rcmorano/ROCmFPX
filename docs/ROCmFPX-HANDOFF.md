# ROCmFPX Handoff

This branch is the handoff package for the experimental ROCmFPX family.

The implementation work was developed in the llama.cpp experiment tree at:

```text
/home/caf/strix-fp4/llama.cpp-mtp-rocmfp4
```

The current local implementation branch there is:

```text
experimental-rocmfpx-branch
```

## What ROCmFPX Is

ROCmFPX is a model-weight quantization family that sits beside ROCmFP4. It is
not a new K/V-only compression layer. The model-file presets are:

- `Q3_0_ROCMFPX`
- `Q6_0_ROCMFPX`
- `Q8_0_ROCMFPX`

The ROCmFP4 path remains the reference for block shape, scale discipline,
kernel coverage, and dequant semantics. K/V cache flags remain runtime settings
in llama.cpp and should not be treated as model quant formats.

## Family Contract

Keep these rules stable unless a test proves otherwise:

- Use 32-weight blocks.
- Use finite unsigned UE4M3 scale bytes.
- Reject invalid scale bytes such as `0x7f` and sign-bit scale bytes.
- Use explicit integer-code-times-decoded-scale dequant math.
- Treat ROCmFP4 as the kernel/quant template, not as a separate inference
  stack.
- Preserve normal llama.cpp runtime features:
  MTP, EAGLE3, speculative decoding, RoPE/attention scaling, and tool calling.

ROCmFPX code ranges are intentionally simple:

| Format | Code range | Scale policy |
|---|---|---|
| `Q3_0_ROCMFPX` | `0, +/-1, +/-2, +/-4` | 2 scales, 1 per 16 weights |
| `Q6_0_ROCMFPX` | signed magnitude up to `31` | 2 scales, 1 per 16 weights |
| `Q8_0_ROCMFPX` | signed int8 clamped to `[-127, 127]` | 1 scale per 32 weights |

## Agentic Presets

Use the agent presets when the model needs to behave well in tool-driven or
JSON-heavy workloads:

- `Q3_0_ROCMFPX_AGENT`
- `Q6_0_ROCMFPX_AGENT`
- `Q8_0_ROCMFPX_AGENT`
- `Q4_0_ROCMFP4_COHERENT` for ROCmFP4 agent-oriented builds

These presets do not change the tensor layout. They spend extra precision on the
parts that matter most for agents:

- token and output embeddings
- attention Q/K/V/O
- selected FFN-down tensors
- selective FFN-gate tensors
- bulk FFN-up tensors

The practical rule is simple: keep straight quants for size/speed sweeps, use
agent presets when the workload depends on structured output or external tool
calls.

## K/V Cache Rule

The ROCmFPX model family is separate from cache quantization, but cache types
still matter at runtime.

- `Q3_0_ROCMFPX` is usable for V cache.
- `Q3_0_ROCMFPX` is not acceptable for K cache in the current build.
- `common/common.cpp` promotes `-ctk q3_0_rocmfpx` to `q6_0_rocmfpx` and logs a
  warning.

This is a coherency safeguard, not a new compression scheme.

## How To Build

Use the repo’s existing build scripts for the relevant GPU family:

| Target | Script |
|---|---|
| Strix Halo / RDNA3.5 (`gfx1151`) | `scripts/build-strix-rocmfp4-mtp.sh` |
| RDNA2 (`gfx1030` class) | `scripts/build-rdna2.sh` |
| RDNA3 (`gfx1100` class) | `scripts/build-rdna3.sh` |
| RDNA4 (`gfx1200` class) | `scripts/build-rdna4.sh` |

The usual local build pattern is:

```bash
cmake --build build-strix-rocmfp4 --target llama-quantize llama-cli llama-server llama-bench test-backend-ops -j 8
```

For Strix Halo runs, the working runtime pattern is:

```bash
HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.5.1 \
GGML_HIP_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1 \
./build-strix-rocmfp4/bin/llama-cli -m /path/to/model.gguf -dev ROCm0 -ngl 999
```

## How To Quant

Use BF16 or F16 source GGUFs for real quantization. Re-quantizing an already
heavy quant is useful for smoke tests, not for best quality.

The main wrapper is:

```bash
scripts/quantize-rocmfpx-agent.sh
```

Examples:

```bash
SRC=/path/to/model-BF16.gguf OUT=/path/to/model-Q8_0_ROCMFPX_AGENT.gguf \
  FORMAT=rocmfp8 PROFILE=agent scripts/quantize-rocmfpx-agent.sh

SRC=/path/to/model-BF16.gguf OUT=/path/to/model-Q4_0_ROCMFP4_COHERENT_AGENT.gguf \
  FORMAT=rocmfp4 PROFILE=agent scripts/quantize-rocmfpx-agent.sh

SRC=/path/to/model-BF16.gguf OUT=/path/to/model-Q6_0_ROCMFPX.gguf \
  FORMAT=rocmfp6 PROFILE=straight scripts/quantize-rocmfpx-agent.sh
```

The wrapper maps to these presets:

- straight FP3 -> `Q3_0_ROCMFPX`
- agent FP3 -> `Q3_0_ROCMFPX_AGENT`
- straight FP4 -> `Q4_0_ROCMFP4`
- agent FP4 -> `Q4_0_ROCMFP4_COHERENT`
- straight FP6 -> `Q6_0_ROCMFPX`
- agent FP6 -> `Q6_0_ROCMFPX_AGENT`
- straight FP8 -> `Q8_0_ROCMFPX`
- agent FP8 -> `Q8_0_ROCMFPX_AGENT`

## How To Test

Use the dedicated smoke harness:

```bash
scripts/check-rocmfpx-agentic-smoke.sh
```

It validates:

- chat coherency
- coding output
- strict JSON output
- tool-call JSON shape
- three-bullet coherency summary
- streaming protocol

The script refuses to start if ROCm already reports an active KFD process, and
it idles briefly before loading the next model.

## Observed Local Results

These are the current local reference points from the Strix Halo workspace:

- ROCmFP8 agent quant from BF16: `31,568.94 MiB`, `8.39 BPW`
- ROCmFP4 agent quant from BF16: `17,136.79 MiB`, `4.55 BPW`
- ROCmFP4 agent bench: `pp512 650.63 t/s`, `tg128 76.55 t/s`
- ROCmFP4 agent smoke: pass
- ROCmFP8 agent smoke: pass
- BF16 baseline smoke: pass

## Review Notes

If you are extending the family, check these first:

1. `docs/ROCmFPX-EXPERIMENT.md`
2. `ggml/rocmfpx/README.md`
3. `scripts/quantize-rocmfpx-agent.sh`
4. `scripts/check-rocmfpx-agentic-smoke.sh`
5. `src/llama-kv-cache.cpp`
6. `common/common.cpp`

The point of the branch is to keep the ROCmFPX family straightforward:
straight quants when the user wants size and speed, agent presets when they want
better structured output and tool behavior, without making either path hard to
use.
